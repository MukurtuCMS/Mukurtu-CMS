# Description

The Mukurtu Comments module provides protocol support for standard Drupal comments. Only the read and inheritance protocol fields are added, the write protocol field is not added or used. By default, a comment will automatically inherit the protocol field value(s) from the containing entity, restricting the visibility of the comment to the visibility of the containing entity. Standard Drupal permissions are used to control edit access to the comment.
