# Testing plans

Here is a running list of test case media I thought of:
- one ppl warning
- multiple ppl warning
- one taxonomy warning
- multiple taxonomy warnings
- one ppl warning, one taxonomy warning
- one ppl warning, multiple taxonomy warnings
- multiple ppl warnings, one taxonomy warning
- multiple ppl warnings, multiple taxonomy warnings

Also must test how single and multiple media assets render. Content type is irrelevant as long as it has the media assets field.
